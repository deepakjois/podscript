# podscript

podscript is a tool to generate transcripts for podcasts (and other similar audio files), using LLMs and other Speech-to-Text (STT) APIs.

## Install

```shell
> go install github.com/deepakjois/podscript@latest

> ~/go/bin/podscript --help
```

## Web UI
Podscript has a web based UI for convenience

```shell

```

This runs a web server on at `http://localhost:8080`
