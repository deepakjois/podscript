# podscript
podscript is a tool to generate clean transcripts for podcasts (and other similar audio files), using LLMs and other Speech-to-Text (STT) APIs. Currently, [ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) and [Deepgram](https://playground.deepgram.com/?endpoint=listen&smart_format=true&language=en&model=nova-2) are supported.

## Prerequisites
You need an API key for at least one of the following services to use podscript:
* [ChatGPT API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), to clean up and transcribe YouTube autogenerated captions.
* [Deepgram API Key](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/make-your-first-api-request#create-a-deepgram-api-key) to transcribe any podcast audio file. Deepgram has some excellent and cheap STT models and offers free signup and $200 in credit to get started.
* _(more APIs, for e.g. Claude and OpenAI Whisper will be supported in the future. Contributions are welcome)_
